## Important notes

Anything specifed in square brackets (`[]`) applies to every meaning until the next period (`.`). Anything in paranthesis (`()`) applies for that one meaning only. 

All verbs are specified in their infinitive form, unless the specific form carries more or a different meaning than can be deduced (i.e. `eztelassem` (*see* [*Interjections*](dictionary-en_US.md#interjections)).)

If a verb's transitivity is not specified then it can be both transitive and intransitive.

A noun/adjective may be specified as only being only an adjective, only a noun, or both. In reality, almost any noun can be used as an adjective, and almost any adjective can be used as a noun. The ones listed are simply what I came up with.

## Proper nouns (with `!`)

Some words begin with an exclamation mark `!`, this means that they are proper nouns. Only present in writing, not vocalized. Any noun can be turned into a proper noun using it.

## la

`la` is used at the end of a question sentence to indicate that it is a question.

## ter..., ret... and Other Linking Words

`ter` and `ret` are used to link together different clauses. 

`ter` may appear at any point in the first clause if it is used as an object. If it is just being used to link clauses, without sharing a word (which is done by using it as an object,) it must be placed at the end. `ret` must always appear at the start of the second clause, as it is a delimeter. 

If `ter` is used as an object, `nlel` will link together with it, "sharing" the word they represent.

If they are side-by-side, they are pronounced as a single word. 

Some additional sentence linking words:

- `per` - and.
- `rev` - or.
- `per..., per...` - both..., and....
- `rev..., rev...` - either..., or...
- `mrem` - if. Used at the start or end of a conditional to form an if statement.
